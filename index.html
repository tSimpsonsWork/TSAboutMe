    <h3>About summary</h3>
    <p>
      I am current enrolled at
      <strong>Florida International University</strong> as a computer science
      student who is aiming to have a career in Software Engineering.
      Originally, I was pursuing the career path of becoming a pharmacist but
      decided to have a career change and go back to school. My newfound
      interesting in programming and technology has been a great way to
      introduce me to a different and unique side of Stem. What I have learned
      from the classes I have taken so far has intrigued me to learned both the
      frontend and the backend part of programming. The projects I have worked
      on displays both my competency in either development track, but I am
      mostly interested in backend programming. What I noticed since coming into
      tech is an increase in minority programmers which gives me a good sign of
      how diverse this career path can be. I am willing to learn and build my
      skillsets in an environment that is not only engaging, but also
      challenging.
